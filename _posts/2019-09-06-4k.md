Here is a really useful tool: <a href="https://www.4kdownload.com/products/product-youtubetomp3/?r=free_license">4K YouTube to MP3</a>. This is really nice to download audio from Youtube videos (and playlists) as MP3 files to listen to offline without having to stream them. For example, lectures for listening to in the car, or playlists of artists’ music that I want to listen to later. It’s really good for conserving your data plan when listening to long videos of live performances; you can listen without having to stream the video, offline if you wish.

I’ve also used it to replace “broken” files for albums that I’ve ripped from
CD. There have been some where either the file gets messed up, or maybe there was a mar on the disc when I ripped it. Anyway, out of that whole album, there’s one song that didn’t work. So, I found where someone had put it on YouTube or VEVO, got it as an MP3, and replaced the broken file in my music library. Album saved!
