Here is a really useful tool: <a href="https://www.4kdownload.com/products/product-youtubetomp3/?r=free_license">4K YouTube to MP3</a>. This is really nice to download audio from Youtube videos (and playlists) as MP3 files to listen to offline without having to stream them. For example, lectures for listening to in the car, or playlists of artists music that I want to listen to later. Itâ€™s really good for conserving your data plan when listening to long videos of live performances; you can listen without having to stream the video, offline if you wish.</p>

<p>Here is a shot of it in action:<br>
