<p>Second blog post for today, here are the first steps I do when installing Windows 10 from scratch:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Windows</li>
<li>Get it on the network (this may involve downloading drivers)</li>
<li>Run <a href="https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10">O&O ShutUp 10</a>.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/wumt_wrapper_script.html">Sledgehammer</a> and install updates.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/">Ublock Origin</a> into Edge (later, use Edge to get Chrome and Firefox, and put Ublock Origin into those, too)</li>
<li>Install some sort of antivirus (maybe <a href="https://www.avast.com/">Avast</a>, but it depends on where the machine is going to be used; at work, we have other software)</li>
</ol>

<p>There are reboots here and there, which I didn't mention. After these things, I usually start installing applications. Often installed applications include Notepad++, PDFCreator, and the aforementioned Chrome and Firefox.</p>
