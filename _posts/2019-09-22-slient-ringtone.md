<p>It is possible to set an alarm in the iOS Clock app which doesn't make any
noise when it goes off; rather, it just vibrates. This is done by setting the
"Sound" to "None".</p>

<p>However, for whatever reason, you can do this for a Timer. You have to pick 
a ringtone for a timer, there is no "None" choice.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem (yes, Apple, it's a problem) is to have a ringtone
that is silent, and choose that one when you set the Timer. This is document on 
very many web sites, where it is then also explained how to create your own silent
ringtone. I do not understand why there aren't any silent ringtones out there to 
download (maybe there are, and I just didn't find them), but, here is one:</p>

<p><a href="/downloads/silent.m4r">silent.m4r</a></p>

<p>Download this, plug your phone into your computer, and fire up iTunes. Go to 
your iPhone, go down to Tones, and drag the silent.m4r from your computer over to the 
Tones folder. Let your phone sync, and then there should now be a "silent" choice
when you select the sound for a timer.</p>
