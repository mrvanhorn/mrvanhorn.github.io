<p>Here’s a tip:</p>


<p>
Set a timer on your phone, so that you don’t miss when the washer or dryer finishes. Our washer and dryer tell you how long it will be before they finish; if yours doesn’t have that, you should know how long it takes to run.  Start the machine, and then set the timer. You don’t have time to waste with wet clothes sitting in the washer starting to smell, or dry clothes sitting in the dryer getting wrinkly. Don’t waste time just because you can’t hear when your appliances turn off.
